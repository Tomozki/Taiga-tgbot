MARKDOWN_HELP: |
    ──「 Markdown Help 」──

    Markdown is a very powerful formatting tool supported by telegram. {dispatcher.bot.first_name} has some enhancements, to make sure that \
    saved messages are correctly parsed, and to allow you to create buttons.

    ❑ <code>_italic_</code>: wrapping text with '_' will produce italic text
    ❑ <code>*bold*</code>: wrapping text with '*' will produce bold text
    ❑ <code>`code`</code>: wrapping text with '`' will produce monospaced text, also known as 'code'
    ❑ <code>[sometext](someURL)</code>: this will create a link - the message will just show <code>sometext</code>, \
    and tapping on it will open the page at <code>someURL</code>.
    <b>Example:</b><code>[test](example.com)</code>

    ❑ <code>[buttontext](buttonurl:someURL)</code>: this is a special enhancement to allow users to have telegram \
    buttons in their markdown. <code>buttontext</code> will be what is displayed on the button, and <code>someurl</code> \
    will be the url which is opened.
    <b>Example:</b> <code>[This is a button](buttonurl:example.com)</code>

    If you want multiple buttons on the same line, use :same, as such:
    <code>[one](buttonurl://example.com)
    [two](buttonurl://google.com:same)</code>
    This will create two buttons on a single line, instead of one button per line.

    Keep in mind that your message <b>MUST</b> contain some text other than just a button!

    Do stickers annoy you? or want to avoid people sharing links? or pictures? \

    non-admin users from sending stickers, etc.
    Locking bots will stop non-admins from adding bots to the chat.
